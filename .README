## Title-
##       /home/data/home/.README
##
## Purpose-
##       Describe subdirectory content.
##
## Last change date-
##       2022/04/27
##
## Implementation notes-
##       This distribution is kept locally in /home/data/home/. In addition
##       to this public distribution, the /home/data/. directory contains
##       information shared between multiple machines.
##
##       Links into /home/data that do not also link to /home/data/home
##       are used at times similarly to links to /home/data/usr/.
##       In particular, java web applications cannot use links when running
##       in Cygwin, so we use a direct path to /home/data/web/database/
##       instead.
##
## Subdirectory information-
##       .git  The git repository
##       bat   Cygwin/Linux batch files, most using the bash script engine.
##       bin   Binary executable (placeholder.)
##       obj   Object subdirectory.
##           Note: this subdirectory IS NOT included in the distribution.
##           Normally you create it using: mkdir ~/obj; mkdir ~/obj/.git
##           and populate it using: cd src; .README restore
##       src   Source files.
##           src/obj contains the associated object git repository
##       usr   Imported files (content not distributed.)
##           Kept here for personal machine-to-machine backup.
##           (TODO: Provide a mechanism for auto-downloading external content.)
##
## Development tree installation-
##       Create a link to this subdirectory
##           (sudo) ln -s <this subdirectory> /home/data
##
##       Create build subdirectory (These instructions assume it's: ~/.)
##           ln -s /home/data/bat ~/.
##           ln -s /home/data/src ~/.
##           ln -s /home/data/usr ~/.
##           mkdir ~/bin
##           mkdir ~/obj; mkdir ~/obj/.git
##           cd ~/src/obj
##           ./.README restore
##
##       Make sure ~/bat and ~/bin are in your $PATH
##           export PATH="$HOME/bat:~HOME/bin:$PATH"
##           (Normally placed somewhere in .bash_profile)
##
##       Install prerequisite build binary
##           cd ~/obj/cpp/Tools/Makeproj
##           ./make
##           strip makeproj; mv -i makeproj ~/bin
##
##       Install C++ library
##           cd ~/obj/cpp/lib
##           make
##
## Included C++ libraries-
##   src/cpp/inc-
##   src/cpp/lib (built in obj/cpp/lib)-
##       This is a set of four sub-libraries: com, gui, obj, and pub.
##       For each library LIB, the interfaces are defined in src/cpp/inc/LIB;
##       outline code is in src/cpp/lib/LIB; and a set of regression tests
##       are in src/cpp/lib/LIB/Test.
##       The com library contains a large set of general-purpose functions.
##
##       The gui library contains a small set of graphical user interface
##       functions.
##
##       The obj library contains a small set of objects. The Object class
##       defines an object to be deleted when its reference count becomes 0.
##       The Ref object references an object. The Object/Ref relationship
##       is completely thread-safe.
##
##       The pub library is the current function development library.
##
##       The com, gui, and obj libraries operate on Linux, Cygwin, and
##       Windows systems. The pub library is limited to Linux and Cygwin only.
##       Most Linux testing is done using Red Hat Fedora, but Ubuntu is also
##       used for regression testing. Cygwin is tested under Windows 10.
##
##       Windows functionality is no longer developed or regression tested,
##       and the object subdirectory required to build using Windows is not
##       provided. (It exists but has not recently been regression tested.)
##
##       Of note: src/cpp/inc/pub/Worker.h
##         Worker.h provides an efficient thread pool control mechanism.
##
##       Of note: src/cpp/inc/pub/Dispatch*.h
##         The Dispatcher objects provide an efficient work flow control
##         mechanism. While each Dispatcher Task processes one work Item at
##         a time (in single threaded mode,) multiple Tasks can simultaneously
##         enqueue work items. The atomic operations required for this
##         functionality are provided by the library.
##
## C++ (interesting) packages-
##   ** ALL included packages require library package installation **
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Clone
##       Clone subdirectory using rdserver/rdclient pair.
##       Similar to rsync.  See S/.README for detailed information.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Edit
##       Source code editor using ncurses library. (Well tested.)
##       In development: ~/obj/cpp/Xcb/Edit
##           Source code editor using Xcb interfaces.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Edit/Xcb
##       Migrating ~/obj/cpp/Edit to use xcb interfaces.
##       (Watch the progress of an editor being developed.)
##       This might get split into Editor and Xcb interface components,
##       once completed.
##       (Already contains some WORKING sample xcb interface usage I couldn't
##       find anywhere else.)
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Fileman
##       Subdirectory file search, uses src/cpp/inc/pub/Fileman.h interfaces.
##       Subdirectory file checker. (Used to find/fix source problems.)
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Forth
##       A trivial Forth interpreter. (Only usable from console.)
##       Derived from src/asm/x86/tlc.32, omitting compile features.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Howto
##       A somewhat useful set of C++ how-to reminders.
##       Most used: src/cpp/Howto/Getopt.cpp (skeleton program)
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/HTTP
##       Sample SLL client/server programs.
##       One uses openssl socket layer, another uses openssl/bio.h interfaces.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Poker
##       For Texas Hold-'em hand monte-carlo evaluation.
##       (The self-play strategy needs work.)
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Sample
##       A set of pretty naive sample programs. These are mostly used to
##       get a handle on how system interface usage.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Sorter
##       A comparison of different sorting techniques.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Stock
##       An attempt to beat the stock market using historical data.
##       Result: Don't bet on the past predicting the future.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Stress
##       Some pub library stress tests.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Util
##       Some utility functions and tiny fun programs.
##
##   ~/obj/cpp/Wilbur
##       A set of tools used to evaluate word usage patterns.
##       (VERY preliminary to a lanuage interpreter.)
##       See also: ~/obj/cpp/Brian (Brian is dyslexic for Brain.)
##
## C# packages-
##   ~/src/mcs/*
##   ~/obj/mcs/*
##       Mostly basic C# code. Nothing really new here.
##       Contains some C++ code migrated to C#.
##
## Python packages-
##   ~/obj/py/*
##       Similarly to other compiled packages, compilation and execution run
##       from the object directory even though the python byte code is kept
##       in the source directory by the compiler.
##   ~/src/py/lib
##       Contains the python library. In order for python to find this library,
##       use: (sudo) ln -s /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/lib ~/src/py/lib
##       (for each python version used)
##
##   ~/obj/py/aiml
##       This is a wrapper for the AIML ALICE interpreter, with extensions.
##       The interpreter runs both from an HTTP client and the local console.
##
##   ~/obj/py/Brian
##       Similar to ~/obj/cpp/Brian, an extendable command handling platform.
##
##   ~/obj/py/Golf
##       Migration of ~/obj/java/Webapp/usr/fne/golfer
##       Java is becoming less usable as an application platform.

##       Provides: Module stdio, methods: getch and putch
##       Includes: setup.py (for site-package installation.)
##
##############################################################################
## Included OBSOLETE packages-
##
##   src/asm/x86
##       This is a set of OBSOLETE assembler programs. It contains a 16-bit
##       and a 32-bit version of TLC, a trivial Forth (Threaded Language)
##       Compiler. See src/cpp/Forth for the C++ version of this package.
##
##   src/c/lib
##       This has never been productively used except for a jpeg library.
##       The jpeg library build has now been removed. Since it is provided
##       with all major distributions, use the standard package instead.
##       The src/c/inc/com and src/c/lib/com libraries are only used as a
##       placeholder. No useful code is provided in src/c/.
