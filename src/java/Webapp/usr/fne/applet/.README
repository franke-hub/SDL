TODO:
2020/01/21 Replace 'eskesen' in Makefiles with $(USER)
           (And test, of course.)

2013/02/05 Need to allow for 27 and 36 hole golf courses, don't know which
           18 will actually be played.

2012/12/11 Courses with 9 hole variations may have duplicate handicaps
           front and back, but this is not allowed by the verification.

2012/02/09 EventsEdit:
           When course added or changed, automatically select course teebox
           closest to nominal rating, slope, and yardage.

2012/02/09 MonteCarloEvaluation:
           Add optimization to swap players throughout tournament.
           (Only players that play only on the same dates can be swapped.)
           Add (optional) override of weights in the evaluation.

2010/10/19 Do we want to change EVENTS.CARD/POST to match PLAYER.CARD/POST?

##############################################################################
BUGS:
2019/02/22 When updating Hawks Landing, could not add LD/CP to course.
           (Had to update by hand.)

2018/02/02 Changing the event courses clears the EVENTS.TIME arrays.
           This isn't necessary unless the player list changes for any of
           the days. If only the course changes, nothing else should.

2019/02/22 HIT SAME BUG!!!!

2015/02/15 Default: Nominal rating/slope/distance.
           Attempt to match this for default teebox.

2015/02/15 The text in the green scorecard panels is hard to read.
           (It's a lot better when fit to page is NOT selected.)

2014/02/14 Need to have a print scorecard application. This should duplicate
           the title and course name for each group.

##############################################################################
FEATURE:
2008/12/01 Top level selector for Event, Player or Maintenance
           For Event, only show the associated Courses and Players.
           For Player, only show the associated Player.

2008/04/08 Need to automate events selection process, perhaps using a
           login procedure. This could also enable management function.

##############################################################################
ADDED: 2017/03/24 (Done previously)
2009/01/21 Courses can change TBOX information from year to year.
           Historical information should contain rating, slope and yardage.
           EVENTS.TBOX EVENTS_ID.COURSE_ID.TEEBOX_ID rate slope [yardage] {Color}
           Fix: EVENTS.POST contains ESC, RATE, SLOPE, COURSE, TEEBOX

ADDED: 2012/05/26
2012/05/25 PLAYER.HDCP not recognized in PlayerPost.java.
           Added playerHdcp(playerID, sortedDate) method in CommonJApplet,
           this is now used in PlayerView.

ADDED: 2012/05/26
2012/05/26 PlayerView: If date not specified, default to today's date.

ADDED: 2012/02/29
2010/03/14 Need individual statistics page. (Person-by-person)
           Added PlayerStat.java

ADDED: 2011/03/06
2011/03/06 Course update: put tee changes into the database in order.

ADDED: 2008/12/01
2008/03/06 CourseEdit, CourseView show LD/CP information.

##############################################################################
FIXED: 2017/04/03
2014/02/14 In EventsEdit, when changing tee time or player we need to REMOVE
           all associated EVENTS.TIME entries that exist.
           (Teams are invalid after any player tee time change.)
           Also, automatically POST before any team recalculation.

FIXED: 2017/03/24
2017/03/05 Allow fractional CP value.

2017/03/05 Round CP to nearest tenth. (LD appears to already do this.)

2017/03/05 Add sanity check: CP must be less than 100.
           LD must be greater than 100.

FIXED: 2013/03/22
2013/03/21 EventsCard: Does not tab past hole 9 or 18 without data present.
           The same problem occurs in PlayerCard.
           Fix: Do not set InputVerifier if SigmaField input is itself a
           SigmaField. (Tab moves into an invalid, unchangeable field.)

FIXED: 2013/03/21
2013/03/21 Request: Duplicate hole information for each row in score card.

2012/12/11 When a player is added to an event, his current handicap is
           not computed.

FIXED: 2013/03/20
2013/03/20 PlayerHdcp, dates shown in database rather than human order.

2013/02/05 Insert player, PLAYER.FIND nickn (remove) added to DB

FIXED: 2012/02/09
2012/02/05 Teams obviously not optimized properly.
           Major repair/update of MonteCarloTeamEvaluator.
             All evaluators were mathematically incorrect.
             Added additional evaluations, tweaked evaluation weights.
             Added optimization routine to improve on Monte Carlo result.
             Evaluator would get stuck in local minimum and not progress:
             Added multiple evaluation probes to fix this.

FIXED: 2012/05/27

2012/01/08 When updating events, course names go below bottom of screen
           making it impossible to set the names via the maintenance panel.
           Imported MenuScroller.java

FIXED: 2012/05/26
2012/02/29 Player.add handles nickname incorrectly.
2012/01/08 When adding player, the nickname was not added properly.
           PLAYER.FIND P0023 P0023
           PLAYER.FIND P0023 P0023 (not jerry P0023)
           PLAYER.NICK P0023 P0023 (not P0023 jerry)
           (This was a problem with the display, not the logic.)

FIXED: 2011/02/22
2011/02/20 Can't read yardages for tee boxes with white FG when printed.
           CourseTboxInfo updated, all colors have black foreground.

FIXED: 2010/10/17
2010/03/08 Weight day-to-day team variation so that teams change more on
           a day-to-day basis.
           Added sameCount array to fix this.

FIXED: 2010/10/16
2010/03/08 Are DP scores counted for Best2? They shouldn't be.
           They are: see 2010/03/08 Hole #6.

FIXED: 2009/08/18
2009/06/09 PlayerCard fails in PlayerView because no score is loaded.

2009/01/21 Match names: COURSE.TBOX and CourseYardInfo.
           (Now CourseTboxInfo)

FIXED: 2009/05/18 CANNOT REPRODUCE
2009/03/14 LD/CP does not add to course in CourseAdd, works in CourseEdit.

FIXED: 2009/05/17
2009/03/14 DP score does not work properly in result viewer, statistics.
           Frank 3/14 Hole 12

FIXED: 2008/12/03
2008/12/01 CourseView and EventsCard panels contain editable fields.

FIXED: 2008/06/07
2008/03/06 Courses may have both Mens and Womens handicap for holes.
           Need to show both.

FIXED: 2008/04/07
2008/03/06 DP entry saved as 2xPAR rather than "DP".

CLOSED: 2017/03/24 (Already present: PlayerStat.java)
2017/03/05 Need a beer fund result summary display.

CLOSED: 2013/03/21 Currently not worth fixing.

2012/12/11 When updating events, EVENTS.DATE is updated in database

           Closed: Needs Women's rating and slope.
