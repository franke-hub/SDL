## STATUS: 2022/12/29
2022/12/30 The history/message line now separate from the status line.
         The status line is always present.
         Renamed EdInps.cpp => EdTinp.cpp.

##############################################################################
## CHANGE LOG:
2022/12/29 Renamed EdText to EdTerm, also changing this file.

2022/12/20 Default running detached from command line.
         This can be overridden using the '--fg' parameter.

2022/08/25 Redo/Undo on modified line yields inconsistent REDO (crash)
         FIX: Commit current line before processing redo.

2022/08/25 Disallow change command for read-only files.

2022/08/01 MINOR: Looking at trace the EdView temporary copied line was being
         traced during delete but not when allocated.
         EdView and EdFile.EdLine now avoid line delete tracing for that
         temporary line.

2022/03/15 Use Trace::trace functions rather than Config::trace.
         Use ~/.config/editxcb/ rather than ~/.config/uuid/.../ for debug
         and trace output.

2022/03/29 Use Ctrl-Esc to enter ESC character, just like Ctrl-Tab.
         Problem: Ctrl-Esc and Alt-Tab are Windows control sequences, so
         we don't have a clean and common mechanism.
         Solution: Use sequence `Alt-\` to indicate that the next character
         is to be "escaped". Added support for Alt-\ + (\b, \t, or \e).

2022/02/23 Synchronization commit. Added .README TODOs (only.)

2021/12/21 Usability: Added "list" command to display the command list
         Usability: Hitting F4 again removes the "No Files Changed" message

2021/10/01 Fix: EdView.draw_active uses EdTerm.draw_line for display.
         (EdHist.draw_active writes line directly.)

2021/09/08 Mark display update works improperly when line changed.

2021/08/24 Block column move on a blank line left trailing blanks.

2021/08/08 Fixed some user interface annoyances.

2021/08/08 User interface: limit history list to 8 lines
         When the list is over long, it's usually easier to retype a line.

2021/08/08 User interface: button should not cause scroll up.
         This would occur when button pressed below end of file line.

2021/06/26 Hardened Utf8 support, fixing block copy.

2021/06/24 Fixed: UNDO changed active data line, cursor on history line.
         EdInps.cpp needed to use redraw data, not view.
         (Restructured data_active subroutine, moving it to EdView.cpp)

2021/06/23 Fixed: Cursor moves on data left click while in history view.
         EdInps.cpp should use data, not view, for cursor row adjustment.
         (view is a local variable and still points to history.)

2021/06/23 Fixed: Undo change line leaves characters on display.
         EdTerm::get_text now adds blank fill.

2021/06/23 Fixed: Line numbers get messed up when cut offscreen before mark
         Fixed EdFile, EdMark, and EdTerm. (Works, but code feels fragile.)

2021/06/17 Fix: A top line change disappears after mark below. (The change
         is in the file, but not properly displayed on the screen.)
         The problem is that EdTerm wasn't made aware when a head line is
         removed. Fixed by creating a redo signal with an EdTerm listener.

2021/06/17 Added Alt-Pause for debugging: Dump, halt tracing
2021/05/23 Fix: pub::debugging::debug_backtrace replaces Config.backtrace
2021/04/22 Fix: Insert/delete/bs character on line with column mark display
2021/04/22 Usability: Wheel mouse always moves data screen
2021/04/10 Fix: EdMark.cpp: Delete when no mark present.
2021/04/08 Usability improvement: Only show data cursor when Window in focus.

2021/03/22 Fixed file write on different filesystem than save file.

2021/03/15 Added DETAB command, fixing some screen handling glitches.
         Separated EdTerm.cpp into EdTerm.cpp, EdInps.cpp
            Added keypad character handling.
         Handle directory and unusable files better.

2021/03/04 Added protection for Ctrl-TAB on protected line.
         Removed the commented out EdMark debugging code.

2021/03/03 Ctrl-TAB used for actual tab character.
         An easy to implement TODO, but committed implementation incomplete.

2021/03/02 Some TODOs done, including implementing read/only file.

2021/02/28 Implemented locate/change options, including set command
         Added REDO/UNDO for EdFile::set_mode.

2021/02/21 Direct block copy/move (Ctrl-C/Ctrl-M) operational

2021/01/24 Xcb subdirectory moved to ~/src/cpp/inc/gui and ~/src/cpp/lib/gui
         Fixed block cut bug.

2021/01/22 Code review. Xcb/Edit now used by author as default editor.

2021/01/16 Block copy/paste operational using Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V or Ctrl-X/Ctrl-V

2021/01/10 Restructure. Removed TextWindow, function merged into EdTerm.

2021/01/03 Bug fix: EdBifs editor::command, data->commit before any command
         lib/pub/Parser.cpp: Data extraction iterator; Allow duplicate lines
         Config.cpp: Configurable screen colors.

2020/12/15 Added built-in edit function with wildcard name resolution.
         Updated pub library (wildcard file name compare)
         EdMark greatly improved.
         Updated ~/src/obj/git from ~/obj/.git
         Other built in functions added or scaffolded.
         Some objects and functions renamed and/or refactored.
         Removed unused test objects. Only EdMisc remains.

2020/12/11 EdMark implemented (Working, needs usage test)

2020/12/09 Moved Xcb/Edit => Edit/Xcb

2020/12/08 Refactored Editor/Config into a single namespace

2020/12/04 Command line handling.

2020/11/12 Fixed Signals, moving it to pub library (ADL issue)

2020/10/15 Debugged xcb_xfixes_hide_cursor not working
         (It's a Cygwin problem. It works properly on native Fedora Linux.)
         Button handlers implemented. (But not command handling.)
         Line and column numbers handled more accurately.

2020/10/12 Editor singleton object available using Editor::editor
         Fixed Active::replace_text (insert_char wasn't working properly)

2020/10/11 Improved UTF8 handling and documentation
         Combining characters are not handled properly; They don't combine.
         Multiple size_t aliases defined for different purposes.
         (This does not prevent mis-use, but does clarify usage.)

2020/10/02 Pixmap is now the base drawable.
         Deferred truetype font implementation.

2020/09/06 Basic editing functions implemented.
         Valid only as quasi-working XCB example program.

2020/09/07 (MORE) Pre-requisite packages

2020/09/06 Cygwin pre-requisite packages
         libX11-devel                  (probable maintenance update)

## TODO:
2022/04/11 Implement system clipboard.

2022/04/11 Run detab command in background. Use one undo/redo for the entire
         detab. Find first/last detab lines; Those bound the detab.

2022/02/18 Add DIR command, DIR load, Copy block to history
         Special handling for these DIR/BUFFER files

2021/07/03 Clone view (named view://filename)
         Clone a file for split viewing. The view is read-only.
         (No lines need to be allocated. They can just be copied.)

2021/03/04 Consider EdView restructure
         Consider EdView base class, EdData/EdHist based on that.
         Consider splitting: Editor.cpp and EdFile.cpp.
         Also: Config.cpp is 911 lines and Config.patch is ugly.

         For directories, load the file names. (Protected file)
         Draw full background on line 0 (status, message, history)
         Multiple editor windows. (Restructure required.)
           (May not be too hard. Only one window open at a time.)

2021/03/04 TODO: (Search reminder)
         Greps: "TODO:", "HCDM", "USE_BRINGUP", "NOT CODED"

2020/09/05 ** EXPERIMENTAL **
         Code review. Completely test all implemented functions.
            ==> Invalid font: Need better user error message
         Multiple windows. (No search, status, command, or message lines)
         File write not implemented.
         Hide system cursor when typing. (Show when moving mouse.)
         Is draw optimization (double buffering) required?

2020/07/28 Xcb/Device base class: Widget or Window?
         Window (at least for now)

2020/07/28 Need to check whether file is a file or a directory.
         If directory, load R/O file list, selectable files/directories

2020/07/28 Background file loader. Synch with EdTerm

##############################################################################
## DONE:
2022/02/22 Run as a thread so that exitxcb has same window appearance as xterm
2022/12/20 Only needed fork() in Edit.cpp

##############################################################################
## DEFERRED:
2020/10/02 Fontconfig / Truetype fonts
         Fontconfig easy enough to use.
         Truetype extremely difficult to use.
             ONE working example found.
             Most documentation is incomplete. That which exists mostly
             recommends using a higher level interface rather than the X11/XCB
             interface. While looking at the associated higer level source
             code could be an option, it would be too time consuming.

##############################################################################
## FEATURE:
2021/12/21 EdBifs::command_list improved usability.
         Instead of using printf, list the commands in a read/only buffer.

2021/08/28 ?? Change background color in data view rather than status view
         when the file is changed ?? Or both?? color = r,g,b;r,g,b

2021/08/28 ?? Save/file command sets data view (to see line number)

##############################################################################
## OPEN:

##############################################################################
## CLOSED:
2021/08/08 Closed, not reproducable. (Probably fixed by 6/23 or 6/24 change.)
2021/06/18 Bug: Two cursor blocks on screen.
         Associated with clicking on screen when in history view.

##############################################################################
## FIXED:
