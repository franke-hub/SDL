Codepoints U+032A and U+0346–034A are IPA symbols:

    U+032A ◌̪: dental
    U+0346 ◌͆: dentolabial
    U+0347 ◌͇: alveolar
    U+0348 ◌͈: strong articulation
    U+0349 ◌͉: weak articulation
    U+034A ◌͊: denasal

Codepoints U+034B–034E are IPA diacritics for disordered speech:

    U+034B ◌͋: nasal escape
    U+034C ◌͌: velopharyngeal friction
    U+034D ◌͍: labial spreading
    U+034E ◌͎: whistled articulation

U+034F is the "combining grapheme joiner" (CGJ) and has no visible glyph.

Codepoints U+035C–0362 are double diacritics, diacritic signs placed across two letters.

Codepoints U+0363–036F are medieval superscript letter diacritics, letters written directly above other letters appearing in medieval Germanic manuscripts, but in some instances in use until as late as the 19th century. For example, U+0364 is an e written above the preceding letter, to be used for (Early) New High German umlaut notation, such as uͤ for Modern German ü.

OpenType

OpenType has the ccmp "feature tag" to define glyphs that are compositions or decompositions involving combining characters, the mark tag to define the positioning of combining characters onto base glyph, and mkmk for the positionings of combining characters onto each other.
Zalgo text
Main article: Zalgo text
A sentence of Zalgo text

Combining characters have been used to create Zalgo text, which is text that appears "corrupted" or "creepy" due to an overuse of combining characters. This causes the text to extend vertically, overlapping other text.[2] This is mostly used in horror contexts on the Internet. It is typically very challenging for most software to render, so the combining marks are often reduced or completely stripped off.

Notes

For example, when converting between windows-1258 and VISCII, the former uses combining diacritics whilst the latter has a large selection of precomposed characters so a converter using a simple mapping between code values and Unicode code points will corrupt text when converting between them.
