Using EDIT:

Getting started.
----------------
To Edit a file, you type EDIT name.ext, where name.ext is the name of the
file that you want to edit.  If you know about directory qualifiers, you
can use them too.  Any file that you can type, you can edit.

If you edit a file that already exists, you will be positioned at the top
of the file.  You can use the screen movement commands (described later)
to position yourself anywhere in the file.

If you edit a new file, you only get two lines: the "top of file" line and
the "end of file" line.  In order to do anything useful, you will first have
to add lines.  You add lines using the control-enter command.


How it works
------------
The editor does not change anything that exists on your disk until you
explicitly tell it to do so.  When you type you only change a temporary copy
of your file kept in the computer's memory.  This means that even if you make
changes, you don't have to make them permantend.  You can quit, (F3), and leave
the editor without changing your file data.

If you've been typing for a while, and want to make sure that you don't lose
what you've typed, you should save (F2) the copy of your data that's in
storage onto your disk.  The file command, or F3, saves the file on disk, and
then exits.  This is what you'll normally do when you're done editing.

The editor is a "what you see is what you get" editor.  What you type on the
screen is what you get in your file.  If you type the file or print it, except
for block highlighing text looks exactly like it did when you edited it.  When
you type on the screen, you immediately change the copy of the editor that's
in storage, so you always know exactly what you did. Nothing changes on your
real copy of the file until you save or file it.

When you change a file line, any trailing blanks are removed from the line.


Editor commands.
----------------
The normal editing commands work exactly like you would expect them to work,
and you don't need to think of them as commands.  If you type a character,
the character is put on the screen.  The insert, delete and arrow keys work
like you expect them to.  If you'd like to try out these commands, go ahead.
Remember, you won't change the copy of the file that's on the disk until you
save the file.

The commands with an asterisk in front are commands you absolutely have to
know about in order to use the editor.  The rest you can learn as you
need them.


Keyname  CMDname   Description
-------  -------   -----------
<-      *CSR-LEFT  This key moves the cursor one character to the left.

->      *CSR-RIGHT This key moves the cursor one character to the right.

        *CSR-DOWN  This key moves the cursor one character towards the bottom
                   of the screen.
                   If the cursor is on the command line, the next command in
                   the command line buffer is retrieved and placed on the
                   command line.

        *CSR-UP    This key moves the cursor one character towards the top of
                   the screen.
                   If the cursor is on the command line, the previous command
                   in the command line buffer is retrieved and placed on the
                   command line.

->|     *Tab-fwd   This key moves the cursor one tab position to the right.

|<-     *Tab-rev   This key moves the cursor one tab position to the left.

BKSP     (none)    This key is a combination of delete and cursor-left.

Caps     (none)    This key toggles the keyboard Caps-Lock light.  When the
Lock               Caps-Lock light is on, the meaning of the shift key is
                   reversed for alphabetic characters.

DELete  *Delete    This key deletes a character, then moves any remaining
                   characters on the line over to the left

End      End       This key moves the cursor to the right of the last
                   character in the line.

Enter    Enter     The cursor is moved down one line and placed in the first
                   character on that line.
                   If the cursor is on the command line, the command is
                   executed.

Esc     *Command   This key puts the cursor in the command line, or into
                   the file line if you were in the command line.
                   See the editor command section for a list of commands.

F1       No-op     This key has no function.

F2      *Save      The current copy of the file, which was only in storage
                   is copied out onto your disk.  You can continue editing
                   the file but you can't undo any changes you made earlier.

F3      *Quit      This command allows you to exit from the editor
                   without changing the file.  It is real handy when you make
                   a horrible mistake and don't know what to do next.

F4       No-op     This key has no function

F5       Locate    The next occurance (after the current cursor position)
                   of the "Locate" string in the file is found.

F6       Change    The next occurance (from the current cursor position)
                   of the "Locate" string is changed to the "Change" string.

F7       Prev      The previous file in the edit ring is selected for
                   editing.

F8       Next      The next file in the edit ring is selected for editing.

F9       Name      Places the name of the file into the command line.

F10      Top       This key moves the current line to the top of the screen.

F11      Undo      The current line is restored to its value before any
                   typing occurred. If the current line hasn't changed, the
                   previous delete operation is undone.

F12      Redo      NOT IMPLEMENTED. Redo last undo operation.

Home     Home      This key moves the cursor to the beginning of the current
                   line.

INSert  *Insert    This key toggles the insert mode.  When in insert mode, you
                   get a large cursor and characters are inserted rather than
                   replaced.  When you insert a character, all the characters
                   to the right of the character being inserted move over to
                   the right.

Num      (none)    This key toggles the keyboard Num-Lock light.  When the
Lock               Num-Lock light is on, the numeric keypad keys have numeric
                   values rather than command values.  That is, when the
                   Num-Lock light is on, typing 7 on the numeric keypad is the
                   same as typing the character "7".  When the light is off,
                   typing 7 on the numeric keypad is the same as typing the
                   "Home" key.

Pause    (none)    This key was used to pause the computer.  On older versions
                   of Windows, the computer stops until a data key is pressed.
                   On newer versions the key has no effect.

PgUp    *PgUp      This key is used to move the screen window.  You move one
                   page closer to the top of the file.

PgDn    *PgDn      This key is used to move the screen window.  You move one
                   page closer to the end of the file.

Print    (none)    This key has no effect.
Screen

Scroll   (none)    This key toggles the keyboard Scroll-Lock light.
Lock               When this light is on, you cannot change the cursor position
                   outside of the current scren range using the arrow keys,
                   although other keys (such as tab, PgUp and PgDn) continue
                   to operate normally.

Command  Name      Description
-------  ----      -----------
a-       Alt       Hold the Alt key down while pressing the next key.

a-b      mark-blok Mark a block. If another line in the current ring is already
                   marked, the marked block is revised.

a-c      copy      Copy the block.  A column block is copied into the current
                   cursor position. Line blocks are copied after the current
                   line.

a-d     *delmark   Delete the current block.

a-i   r *insline   Add a line to the file.  The new line is added right after
                   the line where the cursor is positioned.

a-j      join      The next line is combined with the current line.

a-l      mark-line Mark a line.  If another line in the current ring is already
                   marked, the set of marked lines is revised.

a-m      move      Move the block.  This is like copy but the block is removed
                   from its old location and inserted into the new.

a-p      format    The set of marked lines are formatted into a paragraph.
                   The begin and end columns are set with the margins command.

a-s      Split     The current line becomes two lines.  The line is split at
                   the cursor.  Characters to the left of the cursor remain
                   in the current line, characters to the right go in the new
                   line which follows the current line.

Editor commands    Description
---------------    -----------
number             The cursor is positioned at the first character of the file
                   at the numeric row "number". Rows begin at 1.

/string/           The cursor is positioned at the next occurance of "string"
l /string/         in the file.  If you need to locate a string which contains
                   "/", you may use the alternate form which allows any
                   non-blank character to be the string delimiter.

bot                Move the "End of File" line to the bottom of the view.

c /from/to/        The next occurance of the string "from" is changed to
                   the string "to".  The first non-blank character in the
                   command line is used to delimit the strings.  (The "/"
                   character is normally used, but any character which is
                   not part of the "from" or "to" string will do.)

detab              Replace tabs within file with space characters.

e, edit <files>    Add more files into the edit ring.

exit               Exit. (Quit all rings.) If a modified file is found,
                   exit confirmation is requested.

                   ending with \r\n.  "mode unix" converts all lines in the
                   ring to unix format, ending with \n (no \r.)

save               Save the current in-memory copy of the ring to disk. This
                   also clears the undo buffer.

screen             Set the screen count. Divides the screen into several
                   split screent.

tabs               Sets the tab stop columns.
